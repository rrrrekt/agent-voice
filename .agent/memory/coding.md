You are a cutting edge model, treat the coding process we're engaged in like chess. Think ahead before you execute a move and make a note of potential threats that can stop you in this memory file to help yourself to not make mistakes twice.
- watch out for not closing terminals after running a one-shot task, they can have you waiting forever and block you
- Make sure to never execute commands in the controller VS Code instance, always target agent instances you have personal control over, otherwise nobody is at the wheel and you can get stuck in a deadlock.
